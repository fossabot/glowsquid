## Next-gen hyperspeed minecraft launcher with all the features and more

**NOTE:** Currently not complete.

## About

Glowsquid is a modded minecraft launcher built on [_tauri_](https://tauri.studio/) and [_svelte_](https://svelte.dev/) for fast performance while still looking beautiful. It's near fully customizable via custom css and can support almost every single mod platform via _server adapters_(docs soon:tm:).

You can see the various components of glowsquid and their own READMEs by going into the `apps` or `libs` folder.
